Hey! I'm Thomas, a Senior Cloud Engineer working from home in sunny Marlborough, New Zealand. 

This blog is a place for me to publish things that I find interesting, or random curly problems that could help others. 

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-q) and [Github](https://github.com/tdq132).
